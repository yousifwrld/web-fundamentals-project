        <p>Space exploration has captivated humankind for centuries. From early astronomical observations to the first
            steps on the Moon, our journey to explore the cosmos has been filled with groundbreaking discoveries and
            technological advances. Today, space missions are more ambitious than ever, aiming to solve some of the
            greatest mysteries about the universe. Missions to Mars, for example, are not only searching for signs of
            ancient life but also testing technologies that could one day support human colonization. Advanced
            telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope are pushing the boundaries of what we know, peering deep into
            the universe to observe galaxies formed billions of years ago. Private companies are also transforming the
            landscape, making space more accessible and laying the groundwork for a future where space travel might be
            as common as air travel. As we look to the stars, each mission brings us closer to understanding our place
            in the cosmos and opens up new possibilities for humankind’s future among the stars.</p>

                        The Mars Rover Perseverance, part of NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, was launched on July 30, 2020,
                        and successfully landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. One of Perseverance's primary objectives
                        is astrobiology: searching for signs of ancient microbial life on Mars. It’s equipped with
                        sophisticated scientific instruments, such as SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with
                        Raman & Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals) and PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray
                        Lithochemistry), which help analyze the Martian surface in unprecedented detail.
                        The rover's Ingenuity helicopter, a technology demonstration, was the first powered flight on
                        another planet. Perseverance is also pioneering new technologies to support future human
                        exploration, such as MOXIE (Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment), which produces oxygen from the Martian
                        atmosphere. The rover is collecting rock and soil samples for a potential Mars Sample Return
                        mission that would allow scientists on Earth to study Mars in ways not possible with robotic
                        tools alone. Through Perseverance, NASA aims to uncover Mars' history and assess its
                        habitability for past or future life.</p>

                    <p><strong>Launch Date:</strong> December 25, 2021. <br>
                        The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a groundbreaking mission that launched on December 25,
                        2021. As the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, JWST has a massive 6.5-meter primary
                        mirror, allowing it to capture detailed images of distant objects with exceptional clarity. Its
                        instruments are optimized for infrared observation, enabling it to peer through dust clouds that
                        often obscure other telescopes' views.

                        JWST’s mission includes studying the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang, observing star
                        and planet formation, and analyzing the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for conditions
                        suitable for life. Some of its main instruments include NIRCam (Near InfraRed Camera), NIRSpec
                        (Near InfraRed Spectrograph), and MIRI (Mid-InfraRed Instrument), which provide the telescope
                        with the ability to capture data across various wavelengths of light.

                        The telescope is located at the second Lagrange point (L2), nearly 1.5 million kilometers from
                        Earth, which provides it with a stable environment for deep-space observations. JWST has already
                        provided stunning images of galaxies, nebulae, and stars, reshaping our understanding of the
                        universe’s evolution and our place within it.

            <h2>Discovery: Water on the Moon</h2>
            <div class="article-content">
                <img src="images/Water_in_the_moon.jpg" alt="Water on the Moon">
                <div class="article-text">
                    <p><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> October 26, 2020. <br>
                        NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) made a breakthrough discovery in
                        October 2020 by confirming the presence of water molecules on the sunlit surface of the Moon.
                        Unlike previous findings of water in permanently shadowed regions of lunar craters, this
                        discovery revealed water in areas exposed to sunlight. This finding has implications for future
                        lunar exploration, especially for NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to establish a sustainable
                        human presence on the Moon.

                        Water on the Moon is critical for sustaining long-term lunar missions, as it could be used for
                        drinking water, oxygen, and even rocket fuel. This potential for in-situ resource utilization
                        (ISRU) would reduce the need to transport water from Earth, making lunar missions more feasible
                        and cost-effective. Future missions may investigate how water molecules are stored and
                        distributed across the lunar surface, and technologies like the VIPER (Volatiles Investigating
                        Polar Exploration Rover) are being developed to map and extract lunar resources.

                        The discovery has encouraged further research into lunar resource management, enabling
                        scientists and engineers to design methods for tapping into this resource. In the long run, a
                        reliable water supply on the Moon could serve as a stepping stone for deeper space exploration.
